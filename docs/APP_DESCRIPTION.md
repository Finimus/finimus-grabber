## Core Functionality

### Intelligent Audio File Loading

Finimus Grabber supports the most widely-used audio formats in professional and consumer environments:

- **MP3** – Universal compressed audio format
- **WAV** – Uncompressed, lossless audio
- **FLAC** – Free lossless compression for archival-quality playback

Files load directly into the application through a simple drag-and-drop interface or traditional file browser. The optimized loading engine handles large files efficiently, with multi-threaded preprocessing that minimizes wait times even for high-resolution audio files exceeding 100MB.

### Advanced Audio Analysis Engine

Once loaded, Finimus Grabber immediately begins analyzing the audio signal using proprietary algorithms designed for musical content:

- **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) Processing** – Decomposes audio into frequency components for harmonic analysis
- **Onset Detection** – Identifies note attacks and rhythmic events with millisecond precision
- **Pitch Tracking** – Real-time fundamental frequency detection across the full audible spectrum
- **Harmonic Analysis** – Separates overtones from fundamentals to isolate melodic content
- **Polyphonic Detection** – Distinguishes multiple simultaneous notes and chord structures

The analysis runs in real-time as the audio plays, or can process the entire file in batch mode for instant results.

### Note Detection & Musical Transcription

Finimus Grabber's core strength lies in its ability to detect musical notes with exceptional precision:

- **Chromatic Recognition** – Identifies all 12 semitones across multiple octaves
- **Microtonal Analysis** – Detects pitch bends, vibrato, and off-grid tuning with cent-level accuracy
- **Velocity & Dynamics** – Captures note intensity for expressive MIDI export
- **Duration Calculation** – Determines exact note lengths for rhythmic accuracy
- **Confidence Scoring** – Each detected note includes a confidence percentage for quality control

The detection algorithm adapts to various musical styles, from clean synthesizer lines to complex acoustic instruments with rich harmonic content.

### Melody & Chord Extraction

Beyond individual notes, Finimus Grabber intelligently interprets musical structure:

- **Melody Line Isolation** – Automatically identifies and extracts the primary melodic content from mixed sources
- **Chord Recognition** – Detects triads, seventh chords, extended harmonies, and inversions
- **Bass Note Tracking** – Separates low-frequency content for rhythm section analysis
- **Multi-Track Separation** – Distinguishes overlapping melodic and harmonic layers

These features enable users to quickly understand the musical composition of any audio file, making transcription and remixing workflows significantly faster.

## Visual Interface & Data Display

### Waveform Visualization

The main display presents a high-resolution waveform view with interactive controls:

- **Zoom & Pan Controls** – Navigate through audio with sample-level precision
- **Amplitude Envelope Display** – Visualize dynamics and transients at a glance
- **Marker System** – Place custom markers for manual editing and reference points
- **Multi-Color Coding** – Different colors indicate detected notes, beats, and structural sections

### Harmonic Spectrum Display

A dedicated spectrogram view shows frequency content over time:

- **Real-Time FFT Visualization** – See harmonics unfold as audio plays
- **Note Overlay** – Detected notes appear as labeled markers directly on the spectrum
- **Frequency Resolution Control** – Adjust analysis granularity for different musical contexts
- **Logarithmic & Linear Scaling** – Choose the view that best suits your analysis needs

### Piano Roll & Musical Notation

Detected notes appear in an editable piano roll interface:

- **MIDI-Style Grid** – Standard piano roll layout familiar to DAW users
- **Quantization Options** – Snap notes to musical time divisions
- **Velocity Bars** – Visual representation of note dynamics
- **Edit Mode** – Manually adjust note positions, lengths, and velocities

## Professional Features

### Manual Editing Tools

While Finimus Grabber's automatic detection is highly accurate, manual refinement tools provide complete creative control:

- **Note Creation & Deletion** – Add or remove notes by clicking directly on the piano roll
- **Drag-to-Adjust** – Modify note start times, durations, and pitches with mouse gestures
- **Velocity Editor** – Fine-tune dynamics for expressive MIDI output
- **Quantize Function** – Align notes to musical grid automatically
- **Undo/Redo System** – Non-destructive editing with unlimited history

### MIDI Export Functionality

Export your analyzed audio as standard MIDI files for use in any DAW or notation software:

- **Type 0 & Type 1 MIDI Support** – Single or multi-track export options
- **Customizable Resolution** – Choose ticks-per-quarter-note for optimal compatibility
- **Channel Assignment** – Route different note layers to specific MIDI channels
- **Tempo Mapping** – Preserve detected tempo changes in exported files
- **Controller Data** – Include modulation, pitch bend, and expression data

MIDI files export in seconds and are immediately ready for import into Ableton Live, FL Studio, Logic Pro, Cubase, Pro Tools, or any MIDI-compatible software.

### Performance & Optimization

Finimus Grabber is engineered for efficiency:

- **Low CPU Usage** – Runs smoothly on modern systems without taxing resources
- **GPU Acceleration** – Leverages graphics hardware for FFT calculations when available
- **Optimized Memory Management** – Handles large files without memory bloat
- **Multi-Threading** – Parallel processing for analysis and UI responsiveness
- **Instant Startup** – No splash screens or lengthy initialization

The application typically uses less than 150MB of RAM and maintains under 10% CPU utilization during analysis on mid-range systems.

### Offline Functionality

Finimus Grabber operates entirely offline with no internet connection required:

- **Zero Telemetry** – No data collection or phone-home functionality
- **Local Processing** – All analysis happens on your machine
- **Privacy First** – Your audio files never leave your computer
- **No Account Required** – Download and use immediately without registration
